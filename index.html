				Bringing together the victim, offender and community to make things right
				<span class="border"></span>
			</h1>
			<p>
				Restorative Justice Louisville (RJL) provides a holistic and restorative approach to the traditional criminal justice system by bringing together the offender, victim and community to make things right. Through facilitated conferences, all parties involved collectively identify harm and determine a way forward that is centered on healing for everyone. Using the restorative justice approach ensures that compassion and restitution are integral parts of the judicial process.

			<p>
				Restorative Justice Louisville is only able to make an impact because of the involvement and support of our community. There are always opportunities to lend us a hand as we strive to make this great city of Louisville a better place for our young adults, whether you have all of the time in the world to help, or no time at all. We've compiled a few different ways that you could get involved with us, but the list definitely doesn't end here. If you have any questions about how you can help out, please send us an email or give us a call at the number listed at the bottom of the page!

					<h2>Make a Donation</h2>
					<p>
						Since RJLou is a non-for-profit, donations are the lifeblood of our operations. If you'd like to donate any amount to our cause, please click the button below to visit our Donations page.

					<h2>Become a Facilitator</h2>
					<p>
						One of the more important roles in our process is that of the individual who keeps in contact with all participants, makes sure that meetings are had, and takes notes and other general bookkeeping related to their case. Unfortunately, demand is usually higher for this role than the supply, so if you think that you'd be interested in becoming a facilitator of a case, give us a shout!

					<h2>Raise Awareness</h2>
					<p>
						No matter how many donations or volunteers we may get, our cause is all for naught if no one even knows that RJLou exists, or how effective its process is. We need your help to spread the word!
